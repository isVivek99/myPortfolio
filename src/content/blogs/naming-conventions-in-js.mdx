## Foreword

Hello folks! I'm back with another blog. This time we're going to talk about
**How to name your variables properly in JS** .

**JS** is a very quirky language, a lot of things **JS** has or does have been borrowed from existing languages or practices, recently I have been reading the book **How JS works?** by **Douglas Crockford**, and he is very opinionated about **JS**. The following is a blog based on one of the chapters from the book.

<Note type="tip" title="Important Information">
  About Douglas Crockford: Douglas Crockford is a software engineer best known
  for discovering and standardizing JSON, authoring “JavaScript: The Good
  Parts”, and shaping modern JavaScript practices. He has worked at Yahoo!,
  PayPal, and was a key voice in the ECMA TC39 standards committee.

## Never use cryptic names or numbers

**JavaScript** wants you to give names (or identifiers) to your variables, properties, and sometimes, functions. It puts **no limit on the length** of variable names — so be generous as much as possible, let your programs tell their own stories.

**Do not use cryptic names.**

Early languages like **BASIC** used variable names such as `A1`. That habit of using one-letter variable names should _not_ exist in modern programs meant to be readable and maintainable.

Mathematicians like terse notations — programmers shouldn’t. Programming should strive to be **literate and self-explanatory**. It’s not mathematics; it’s a different art.

```javascript
let A1 = 10; // ❌ wrong
let initial_number = 10; // ✅ right
```

## Start and end your variable names with a letter

Always start your names with a **letter**, and end them with a **letter**.  
Yes, **JavaScript** allows names to start or end with `_` (underscore), `$` (dollar sign), or even digits — but you _shouldn’t_ use those.

<Note type="tip" title="Important Information">
  These tricks were meant for **code generators and macro processors**. Humans
  should do better.
</Note>

An underscore (`_`) at the beginning or end of a variable often signals a poorly designed global or a property that should have been private. A dangling underscore is basically a red flag for bad coding practices.
The `$` symbol was introduced so that **automated tools** could generate variable names without clashing with yours. If you’re not a program, leave `$` alone.

```javascript
const _variable_one_ = 100; // ❌ wrong
const $variable = 100; // ❌ wrong
const variable_one = 100; // ✅ right
```

---

## Use snake_case over all other cases

**Ideally, we should use spaces to separate words in a variable**

```javascript
let variableName = 10; // ❌ wrong
let variable_name = 10; // ✅ right
let variable name = 10; // ✅ right
```

Of course, programming languages don’t allow spaces in names today.
That’s because compilers in the 1950s had to run in a few kilowords of memory — and spaces were considered an unaffordable luxury.

Interestingly, **FORTRAN** once allowed spaces in names, but later languages didn’t follow that example, even though later languages (including
**JavaScript**) followed **FORTRAN’s** very bad examples of using **=** equal sign as the
**assignment operator**.

## using reserved words

Reserved words are part of **JavaScript** — you cannot use them as variable or function names.

**Here’s the list of reserved words**

```text
arguments, await, break, case, catch, class, const, continue, debugger, default, delete,
do, else, enum, eval, export, extends, false, finally, for, function, if, implements,
import, in, Infinity, instanceof, interface, let, NaN, new, null, package, private,
protected, public, return, static, super, switch, this, throw, true, try, typeof,
undefined, var, void, while, with, yield


```

The existence of reserved words is another misfeature — a relic from the memory shortages of the **1950s** and **1960s**.
They made compiler design slightly easier and saved a few bytes.

But today, with memory being abundant, they’re simply a legacy constraint that programmers have to live with.
And no, you probably haven’t memorized this list — nor should you have to.

There might be a word that perfectly describes your variable, but it has already been allocated to a lousy JS feature that you never use.
Developers should be able to use reserve words for their naming convention and the compiler should not have a problem with it.

```javascript
let class = "A"; // should be allowed
```

## Closing notes

With this we come to the end of this blog, I know the ideas discussed here are not much used in practice. In the author's words,

**I am just a programmer who is trying to figure out the best way to write programs.**
